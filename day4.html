            <h4>08/26/2025 -- Research Ethics</h4>
            <p>Today we had a lecture on research ethics and intelectual property in class. All members of the group were later tested on this. Dr. Psaker (our mentor for this project)
                advised all students "5.0 is great! You should use it to learn" during the portion on AI during the lecture. Our group has taken note of this. The Lab Saftey Agreement was also due today.
