            <p>Once our group met again, we started drafting research topics- keeping them in a google document labeled "research proposals" (pictured below). We looked at a wide variety of intriugeing topics such as drones, electromyography, and supersonic parachutes.
                 We recorded our topics using a specific format where a short summary of the topic was listed, pros and cons were weighed, and related articles to the proposed topics were listed. This allowed our team to efficiently compare the viability of different topics.
