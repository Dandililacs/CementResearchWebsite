                        <p>This research is made possible through the Governor's School at Innovation Park, the best program in Prince William County, which allows high school juniors and seniors attend George Mason University where they can take vigorous STEM courses and preform research!</p>
                        <p>The Governor's School @ Innovation Park (GS@IP) is a partial-day Academic Year Governor's School program with a focus on Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) disciplines. GS@IP serves the school divisions of Manassas City, Manassas Park City, and Prince William County and is housed on George Mason University Prince William Campus. Students attend science, mathematics, engineering, research, and computer science classes at GS@IP in the mornings then return to their base high schools in the afternoons to take courses in social studies, language arts, and electives as well as to participate in extracurricular activities.

                            GS@IP has been in operation since 2010 and serves 166 gifted and talented students from 15 high schools in the three participating school divisions. Most classes are dual enrollment options through George Mason University. GS@IP classes meet Monday through Friday from 7:30-11:15 a.m.</p>
                        <p>The mission of The Governor's School @ Innovation Park is to engage students in rigorous academic study, challenge them to acquire knowledge, develop understanding, think reflectively, and take intellectual and creative risks in problem solving. The purpose of our program is to educate students in the related fields of science, technology, engineering and mathematics in order to prepare them to contribute to the global community of the 21st century. The vision shared by our faculty and participating school divisions is to allow students to encounter a range of opportunities encouraging intellectual and academic excellence</p>
