This is a website i made for my research team to petentially use at competitions or sponsorship events.

I created this website using html, css, and a tad of animation
I struggled when it came to making new things and correctly formatting the css so that all the elements would work with eahother. I created a navigation bar and the cool profiles for the first time. Thsi is genuinely the first website that i'm proud of.

I made this for Parthenon. Hope to see everyone there!!!
