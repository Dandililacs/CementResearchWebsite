                <h2>Rationale</h2>
                <p>The urban heat island (UHI) effect describes the tendency of urban areas to be significantly hotter than nearby rural areas.
                    One of the leading causes of this effect is due to the thermal properties of concrete.
                    Concrete and asphult, cornerstones of urban design, absorb lots of thermal energy and slowly radiate it into the environment (Zafra, 2025).
                    Not only does this make urban areas hotter and much worse to live in during warm seasons, but it is also highly wasteful energy-wise. 
                    Of course, building solar panels into sidewalks and roads would be impractical. Thus, by utilizing the Seebeck effect, a phenomenon in which a temperature difference between semiconductors creates voltage, concrete can be modified into modules for harnessing thermoelectric energy.
                    Thermoelectric devices are suitable for this need, since they emit no carbon dioxide emmissions and have no moving parts (Singh et al., 2021).
                </p>
                <p>Cement-based thermoelectric materials (CTEMs) are a rapidly expanding field of scientific research.
                    Increases in energy demand and the introduction of carbon nuetrality goals have made CTEMs a popular field of research in recent years (Li et al., 2025).
                    This research will also allow remote area to have off-grid clean energy generation with zero moving parts. 
                    Additionally, the conversion from thermal energy to electrical will aid in mitigating the UHI effect and reduce heat waste in urban areas.
